## About
This application is my first time attempting to use React. I took this opportunity to become famiar with the large folder structure that comes with the react components, and home they fit together into one page. I also became more familiar with using classes in this assignment. I used them to sort through the information in the json file to return back only items that fit a certain discription, or put it in order. The design for this app is based on a past project (see here: ), that created a item selling app for colleges. It sorted by item type to help users find what they wanted, but I recieved feedback that it should include more categories. This is why I used this poortunity to figure out how to add a way to sort it by a search bar, alphabetically, or by price. I now have a much better grasp on the basics of react, and plan to use this knowledge to further create new projects using react.
